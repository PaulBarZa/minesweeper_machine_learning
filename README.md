## Minesweeper solvers

This repository contains two solvers of the minesweeper game. A constraint satisfaction and logic solver and a Double Deep Q-Learning model. All the explanations, results and the sources I relied on are in the pdf "Results" present in this repository.

## To run this project

Dependencies :

> numpy |
> tensorflow |
> pickle

### To run the CSP solver :

Go to **csp_main.py**, ajust game(s) parameters and run this py file.

### To run the Deep Q-Learning solver :

Same, go to **ddqln_main.py**, ajust game(s) parameters and run.
Enter an existing **MODEL_NAME** if you want to use it, or a non existing one to create it.
